# React Community Best Practices

React.js is unopinionated. This is smart. It gives the open source community room to shape react-development.

Conventions are important. For developing at scale. For efficiency/speed. For making life easier for new developers.

This is an attempt at defining best practices for development with React. Everybody is invited to contribute, just open a pull request.
